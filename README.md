# Simple Map Coordinates

This is an extremely lightweight coordinates addon. It puts coordinates on the map, with some minimal configuration so you can decide where they should be.

## Usage

Once installed, there'll be coordinates on the world map frame. By default, they appear inside the frame at the bottom.

If you want to change this, type `/smcoords` and the options will appear.

You can choose:
* Where to show the coordinates:
 * Below the map, inside the frame
 * Below the map, outside the frame
 * In the map's title bar
* Whether to show:
 * The player coordinates (if they're on the current map)
 * The mouse cursor's coordinates (if it's over the map frame)
 * The map's ID (mostly a dev thing, but you might want to know it for addons like TomTom)
* And how precise the coordinates should be (10.1, 10.12, 10.123, 10.1234)
